# DeepLearning
Predicting fraud is a slightly different case, when designing a predictive algorithm. 4 algorithms are implemented here using under sampling technique while using k-fold cross validation. 
## Accuracy
### Logistic regression - 65.99% 
### Neural network  - 68.75 %
### Xgboost - 75.66 %
### Xgboost with unstratified splitting - 85.84 % 

###The script uses Python version=3.5.5, Keras=2.2.0, TensorFlow=1.8.0.
